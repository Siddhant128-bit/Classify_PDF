<h1 align='center'> Document Classification System using Multinomial Naive Bayes Theorem </h1>

This note is to log the development process of the overall system. So let's begin 
<h3> What is this system about ? </h3>
<div align='left'>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea is we are going to build a system which can read any pdf and build a profile using vectorizer like count vectorizer this will make our system capable of understanding what kind of words are there in such document type and hence will be able to predict any new document as one of the previous datatypes </p>
</div>


<h3> How does it work </h3>

<div align='left'>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially we train our model to understand datas from past which are labeled as particular topic realted or not. Then we are going to use various unknown data for inference testing and see how well it performs. </p>
</div>

<h3> Where can  it work </h3>

<div align='left'>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our system as of now works only with pdf documents but we can make it adaptable to work with any datatype provided we can read the text from that particular file.</p>
</div>

<h3>Let's learn more </h3>

<div align='left'>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This log file will be updated as I develop more about this system and hence we can track how the work has been going on.</p>
